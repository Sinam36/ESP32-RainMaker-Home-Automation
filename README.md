- AceButton library
- EEPROM library

---

## 8. Functional Description

### 8.1 LED Load Control

Each LED acts as a logical appliance.  
The ESP32 directly controls LEDs through GPIO pins, making this project a safe prototype of a real home automation system.

---

### 8.2 Physical Push-Button Control

- Each push button toggles its corresponding LED.
- Implemented using the AceButton library.
- Features software debouncing and non-blocking operation.

Button press results in:
1. LED state toggle  
2. EEPROM update  
3. Cloud state synchronization  

---

### 8.3 EEPROM State Persistence💾

- LED states are stored in EEPROM.
- After power loss or reset, the ESP32 reads stored values and restores all LED states automatically.

| EEPROM Address | Load |
|--------------|------|
| 0 | LED 1 |
| 1 | LED 2 |
| 2 | LED 3 |
| 3 | LED 4 |

---

### 8.4 ESP RainMaker Cloud Control☁️

- Each LED is registered as a Switch device in ESP RainMaker.
- Allows remote ON/OFF control and real-time state monitoring.
- Cloud updates are reflected immediately on hardware.

---

### 8.5 Amazon Alexa Voice Control🗣️

- Devices are automatically discovered by Amazon Alexa.
- Example commands:
  - “Alexa, turn on Switch 1”
  - “Alexa, turn off Switch 3”

Voice commands propagate through:
Alexa → RainMaker Cloud → ESP32 → LED → EEPROM

---

### 8.6 Wi-Fi Provisioning (BLE)

- Initial Wi-Fi setup is performed via BLE.
- A QR code is displayed on the Serial Monitor.
- Credentials are securely transferred using the RainMaker mobile application.

---

## 9. Execution Flow

1. ESP32 powers on via USB  
2. EEPROM states are read  
3. LEDs are restored to previous states  
4. RainMaker node and devices initialize  
5. BLE provisioning starts (first-time setup)  
6. Normal operation begins  

---

## 10. Safety & Design Notes ⚠️

- No AC mains or relay modules are used
- LEDs replace real appliances for safety
- Suitable for laboratory experiments and academic evaluation

---

## 11. Future Scope

- Replace LEDs with relay modules for real appliances
- Add OTA firmware updates
- Integrate energy monitoring

---

## 12. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a modern IoT-based home automation system using an ESP32, integrating physical control, cloud connectivity, voice interaction, and non-volatile memory in a safe and structured implementation.
